# Journey

The project implementation started the first of april, in the first days we made 
a feasibility study and brain storming for possible implementations; the third day we reach the 
baseline (rendering the terrain from an heightmap).

After we start scouting the ThreeJS documentation and the examples.

The sixth day Intro was completed and pushed to the repo.

Finally, the last day, the intro was integrated with the terrain builder script 
with also `PointerLockControls.js` and `dat.gui` libraries.

Unluckily half of the team had the flu and the implementation deadlines have not been met as we expect;
anyway the project was completed, respecting all the guidelines.
